Here’s a complete step-by-step sequence of AT commands you can type into PuTTY (over your STM32 ⇄ SIM7600GH UART link at 115200 8 N 1) to bring up an HTTPS GET to your `/insert.php` endpoint and see the response in the terminal:

> **In PuTTY**: Open a **Serial** connection on your COM port at **115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit**. Then type/paste each line below (hit Enter after each), and when you see the `>` prompt, paste the HTTP request (including blank line) and finish with **Ctrl+Z** (ASCII 0x1A).

---

```
AT
```

Should return `OK`.

```
AT+CPIN?
```

SIM ready?

```
AT+CREG?
```

Registered to the network?

```
AT+CGATT?
```

GPRS attached?

```
AT+CSQ
```

Signal strength.

```
AT+CGDCONT=1,"IP","live.vodafone.com"
```

Set your APN.

```
AT+NETOPEN
```

Bring up the IP session.

```
AT+NETOPEN?
```

Should reply `+NETOPEN: 1`.

```
AT+CIPSSL=1
```

Enable SSL/TLS.

```
AT+CIPSTART="TCP","nizarmohideen.atwebpages.com","443"
```

Open a secure TCP socket.
→ You’ll see something like `OK` then `+QIOPEN: 0,0` when connected.

```
AT+CIPSTATUS
```

Verify `STATE: SSL CONNECTED` (or similar).

```
AT+CIPSEND=107
```

(107 = the total bytes of the GET request below, including CRLFs)

*Now PuTTY will show a single* `>` *prompt*. Paste exactly:\*

```
GET /insert.php?key=a@4K3&distance=123 HTTP/1.1
Host: nizarmohideen.atwebpages.com

```

(That’s **three** lines: the GET line, the Host header, and a blank line.)

*Then press* **Ctrl+Z** *(␚) to send.*
You should see the raw HTTPS response (e.g. `HTTP/1.1 200 OK` and your “OK: received…” body).

```
AT+CIPCLOSE
```

Close the socket.

```
AT+NETCLOSE
```

## Tear down the IP session.

### Tips

* If you get no `>` after `AT+CIPSEND`, increase the timeout or check your `AT+NETOPEN?` status again.
* Adjust the `CIPSEND` byte-count if you change the request text.
* For a POST, you’d do almost the same but build a POST request block (with `Content-Length` header) and send it under the same `AT+CIPSEND=` prompt.
